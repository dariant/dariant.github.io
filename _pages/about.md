I'm a PhD student at the [University of Ljubljana](https://www.uni-lj.si/en/university), [Faculty of Computer and Information Science](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en), advised by Prof. dr. [Peter Peer](https://fri.uni-lj.si/en/about-faculty/employees/peter-peer) and Prof. dr. [Vitomir Štruc](https://lmi.fe.uni-lj.si/en/vitomir-struc/). My research focuses on the generation of synthetic biometric data suitable for training deep learning models in a privacy-preserving manner. 

My current research interests include generative models and deep learning techniques in the fields of image-based biometrics and computer vision. In the past, I’ve also collaborated on research projects outside my PhD topic, including 3D reconstruction of superquadrics and music pattern analysis.
